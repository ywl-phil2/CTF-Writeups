## Description
This is a riddle wrapped within a secret program wrapped within a popular encryption method.

The name of the puzzle hints at the Enigma crypto scheme. Someone suggested looking at Google's CTF https://github.com/g0dd42d/ctf-write-ups/blob/main/googlectf-2022-enigma.md.

Downloaded the cipher text as enigma.txt and looked at Python's Enigma library. https://pypi.org/project/py-enigma/
